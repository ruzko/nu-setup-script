# nu-setup-script
my collection of commands/scripts to run on fresh linux installs

Currently an empty repsitory, as i haven't made the script yet.

Just as advertised, this is a set of scripts/commands that i like to run when setting up new linux installs.
Includes zram, bootwaittime, mount /tmp in zram (if more than 8gb ram),
Mount swap partition in zram (if more than 12gb ram),
Kdeconnect(+appindicator for non plasma DE), clamav recommendeds (extra signature databases, default behavior, multithread),
Htop, iotop, powertop, auto-cpufreq, libreoffice disable java,
Firefox tweaks, etc

More to come.
